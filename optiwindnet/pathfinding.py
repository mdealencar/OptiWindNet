# Terminology used by PathFinder internals:
#   wall: one non-traversable mesh segment; route walls are contour edges of
#     the route, constraint walls are planar constraint edges (borders and
#     obstacles).
#   fence: a sequence of walls forming a polygonal line. Two flavors share
#     this concept: route fences (a cable's run that includes >= 1 constraint
#     edge) and constraint fences (the planar constraint chain itself).
#   chain: the overlap of two fences; chain walking handles these explicitly.
#   portal: a traversable mesh edge between adjacent triangles.
#   channel: the triangle corridor explored through portals.
#   funnel: shortest-path state maintained while advancing along a channel.
#   fan: the full cyclic neighborhood around a vertex, especially a root.
#   cone: one angular region in a fan, bounded by two wall-neighbor vertices.
#     The two bounding walls belong to *distinct* fences — a cone is
#     precisely the wedge that separates two fences at a shared vertex.
#     Two adjacent walls of the same fence (e.g. the two endpoints of a
#     touching fence at one vertex, or the two constraint walls at a
#     non-chain-end vertex) do not form a cone in this sense; they bound
#     the fence's own inside/outside, which is not traversable.
#   prime: a geometry vertex id; pn_id: a pseudonode id in the PathNodes tree.
# Funnel mechanics:
#   portal advance: one `traverser.send((portal, side))` step that feeds a new
#     vertex `_new = portal[side]` into the funnel. It is the unit of channel
#     progress; whether the funnel narrows or the apex moves is decided
#     downstream, inside `_traverse_channel`, from the geometry of `_new`.
#   apex (lagging): the funnel's convergence vertex (`_apex` / `apex`). It
#     stays fixed across "inside" portal advances and only moves when an
#     ultrafar or infranear step forces a wapex walk-back. Comments separate
#     the lagging `_apex` from the per-step `_apex_eff` (effective apex used
#     for the new pseudonode's parent and distance), which can differ on
#     infranear steps where `_apex` itself does not update.
# A chain-end is a constraint vertex where one or more route fences transition
# on/off the constraint (= the start or end of a route fence's on-constraint
# segment). The fences at the chain-end stack cyclically; n distinct fences
# (the constraint fence + the route fences that transition here) define n-1
# chains, one per cyclic-adjacent pair of fences.
#
# A Fence (in this module) records one route fence — i.e. one cable's run
# that includes >= 1 constraint edge:
#   endpoints: (s, t) — the off-constraint primes (= the A-edge endpoints
#     for regular contours, or the shortened-contour edge endpoints).
#   primes_on_constraint: ordered prime-vertex list (>= 1 vertex) along the
#     on-constraint segment.
#   subtree: the cable's subtree id; used as the `sector` label for chain-
#     walk pseudonodes at on-constraint primes so overlapping chains keep
#     distinct (prime, sector) buckets.
# Constraint fences are not represented as Fence instances — their walls
# come from the planar embedding's constraint edges.
Fence = namedtuple('Fence', 'endpoints primes_on_constraint subtree')
# AccessCone: one angular wedge at a chain-end through which a chain can be
# entered or exited. The wedge is bounded by two wall-neighbor primes
# (`left`, `right`) of `vertex` in CW order around `vertex`, and may contain
# zero or more `spokes` (non-bound cyclic neighbors interior to the wedge,
# in CW order from `left` toward `right`). Only chain-interior wedges are
# represented as AccessCones — non-chain regions (the void on the far side
# of the constraint, and any navigable wedge that doesn't separate two
# fences) are not registered, since the chain mechanism has no business
# there.
AccessCone = namedtuple('AccessCone', 'vertex left right spokes')
# Chain: one overlap between two fences. Each chain owns exactly two access
# cones, one at each of its chain-end vertices (or both at the same vertex
# for single-vertex/touching chains). Either cone may serve as entry, with
# the other as exit — what's forbidden is entering and exiting through the
# same cone.
#   subtree: route-fence subtree id, used as the `sector` label for chain-
#     walk pseudonodes so overlapping chains keep distinct (prime, sector)
#     buckets. A route fence whose mp has interior non-constraint hops is
#     split into one sub-fence per contiguous-walls segment; sub-segments
#     share `subtree`, and chain pairing uses `(subtree, mp[0], mp[-1])`
#     to keep the per-segment chains separate.
#   cones: 2-tuple of AccessCone.
#   walks: 2-tuple of prime sequences. walks[i] steps from cones[i].vertex
#     (exclusive) to cones[1 - i].vertex (inclusive). Empty for single-vertex
#     chains where the two cones share `vertex`.

    returned only with a call to method `.create_detours()`.

    Only edges in graph attribute 'tentative' or, lacking that, edges with the
    attribute 'kind' == 'tentative' are checked for crossings.

      P: the planar embedding associated with A

      traversals_limit: maximum number of times a single portal may be traversed
      bad_streak_limit: limit on how many steps in a row without finding an improved
        path the traverser is allowed to take

    Example::

      On ``capacity=2`` instances the defaults may not suffice to find all
